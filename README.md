this is the source files for the bootloadar application of ISP programming.
This bootloader application contains some routines for:
1) Comparion of the design version in the fabric and in the SPI Flash
2) ISP programming 
3) Remapping of u-boot.bin and execution of u-boot.bin from DDR memory

This is currently working for the starter kit (M2S050_ES and LPDDR) 
and the evaluation kit (M2S025T and LPDDR)
